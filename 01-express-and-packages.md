# Express and Associated Packages

## Packages

1. **[Express](https://expressjs.com/)** - Fast, un-opinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js
2. **[Morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan)** - HTTP request logger middleware for node.js
3. **[CORS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors)** - node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS with various options.
4. **[CookieParser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-parser)** - Parse Cookie header and populate req.cookies with an object keyed by the cookie names.
   - Optionally you may enable signed cookie support by passing a secret string, which assigns req.secret so it may be used by other middleware.
5. **[Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/)** - Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server. It features solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, read replication and more.

7. **[Helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet)** - Helmet helps you secure your Express apps by setting various HTTP headers. It's not a silver bullet, but it can help!
8. **[Path](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html)** - The path module provides utilities for working with file and directory paths
9. **[Dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)** - Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into [process.env](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/process.html#process_process_env). Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The [Twelve-Factor App](http://12factor.net/config) methodology.
